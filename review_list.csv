Impressive Performance and Stunning Camera Quality
","
I’ve been using the iPhone 13 for the past 3-4 months, and I am thoroughly impressed with its overall performance. The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and lag-free operation, making multitasking a breeze.The camera quality is a standout feature, capturing vivid and detailed photos in various lighting conditions. The Night mode improvements are noticeable, delivering clear and sharp images even in low-light environments. The Cinematic mode for videos adds a professional touch, creating engaging and dynamic content.The battery life has been reliable, easily lasting a full day with moderate usage. The 120Hz ProMotion display contributes to a silky-smooth experience, enhancing gaming and video playback.The design is sleek and feels premium, while the Ceramic Shield front provides added durability. The introduction of 5G connectivity ensures fast data speeds, enhancing the overall user experience.While the absence of a charger and earphones might be a drawback for some, the iPhone 13’s performance, camera capabilities, and design make it a worthwhile upgrade. Highly recommended for those seeking a top-tier smartphone experience.

I snagged the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival for an unbeatable price of 45,000, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in every way!Screen: The display is absolutely stunning – crisp, vibrant, and the colors pop like never before. Watching videos or scrolling through photos is a treat for the eyes. No complaints here!Hanging: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. This phone handles multitasking like a champ. Switching between apps is smooth, and I haven't experienced any frustrating delays.Battery: The battery life is surprisingly impressive. I can go a full day with normal usage, and it still has juice left in the tank. No more anxiously searching for a charger midday – a definite win!Comfort: The sleek design makes it a pleasure to hold, and the phone is just the right weight. It feels premium and comfortable in my hand, making it a joy to use for extended periods.Image Quality: The camera on the iPhone 13 is a true standout. The photos are sharp, and the night mode is a game-changer for capturing memories in low light. Selfies have never looked this good!Color: I went for the classic Midnight color, and it's elegant and timeless. The finish adds a touch of sophistication, and it doesn't attract fingerprints like some other phones I've had in the past.In summary, getting the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival was an absolute steal. From the incredible screen to the reliable battery life and stunning camera, it's exceeded my expectations. If you're on the fence, take the plunge – you won't be disappointed.

Switched from Android to IOS, loved the experience, but..
","
The phone is awesome. The smoothness, the camera quality, display and the voice clarity are great. There is way better safety as every app asks to get tracked or not, to send you notifications or you can deny it. The phone in itself is so smooth and it’s so easy to edit videos or reels as no lagging is there.While the experience of switching from android to iOS was great, but there are so many things which are way more complicated in iOS.I can’t use true-caller and have to manually check the number, no headphone jack and airpods are kinda not useful for someone who talks for long hours on calls. (Planning to get the lightning cable wired apple earphones).Also, the fact that it does not have fingerprint is kinda shocking as phones starting from 10k also have that feature now, guess apple should really look in to it.Overall, I feel the pros outweigh the cons.Lastly, the BEST feature is the camera. The crystal clear quality of the camera was one of the reasons why I wanted to get the phone. My father has a Z fold, and personally I like the camera of the iPhone 13 way way better. Could be a personal preference, but I am satisfied.

 This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.

Awesome.. better camera quality than 14

I bought this phone on great indian fest. Occasion (obvio half world bought that day 😂)I already used 11 and 12 series before so no overall changes seen, as iphone ui is same on all, but there is major difference in camera quality (for those who are expert in photography) my friend bought 14 from FLIPKART that same day but not satisfied with camera as its not natural and very overtone photos generated, but yes video stability is better in iPhone 14 than 13So over all if you are looking for photography or some vlogging you can go with 13. Or if your budget is not in this range then you can go with 12 as well as there are no major changes

The phone was beautiful in iOS 16, horrible in iOS 17
","
here's my verdict after the iOS 17.1.2 update.* horrible battery life, i end up charging twice a day* camera app freezes in when portrait mode is opened* Phone is much more laggy since the iOS 17 update.* IG reels play in the background at times, even when looking at another reel.* My battery health has dropped from 99% to 91% since the iOS 17 update.* What made the battery life worse was the magsafe charger. If you don't have it yet, don't buy it as it is a  slow charger (for overnight charging) and generates a lot of heat when charging, i ended up buying an  aluminium stand so that the heat would dissipate through the stand.If a company forces you to buy several other products for the customer to use it for its intended purpose, then please choose another device.Westerners don't have to worry about it as they have apple care + clubbed into their purchase in the form of an EMI. Plus , they have theft protection with their apple care + which is not available for the iPhones sold in India.Do not buy an iPhone if its just a status symbol for you, buy it if it suits your needs.

Review after 1 week of usage
","
Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.

Excellent Camera
","
First thing first, checked if the product was original or not. For that, check the following1. If the screen has “True Tone” option.2. Check the Serial Number for “M” letter, indicates its new unit.3. Check if IMEI number of the product is same as mentioned on the box.4. Battery Health should be 100%.Pros:1. Camera is one of the best I have used so far.2. Haptic feedback is very great. I noticed it instantly.3. Battery optimisation is very good. It’s been more than a month and I have never charged it more than 85%. Still I get a days battery easily.4. OS. I have used Android before this. And change in OS was good change as well.Cons:Charge speed is slow. I only charge it when the battery % is around 20%. And it takes 1 to 1.5 hr to charge.Comments:I don’t play any games or do any heavy usage tasks on phone. It’s just daily tasks like social media, YouTube, etc.

Night mode is 🔥if you know how to use it.Performance is good.Display is good.Audio is good.If they could just add some accessories which they  stopped providing with it.

All good but did not get the sealed pack

I have been using iPhone from last 8 year so I am aware of the quality and the features so nothing much to share since its elite in this segment.Just one thing the that iPhone I received was not sealed pack so Amazon team requested to check on the secure packaging like Flipkart

 Okay so talking about the phone, before the delivery i was worried about the product as i saw there were not many reviews from other buyers about the seller.. But delivery went well and i got the iPhone.No lies the phone is so far good but there's a catch when i unboxed the package the iPhone box had some dirt on it not too much but it was there then inside the box there was the phone which had some of dust particles on it i don't know how but the phone was sealed packed!!Now talking about the phone it's nice and it's been just one day of having it.. Will write a full review after a longer usage then conclude my thoughts on it but ya phone looks and feel in Starlight color is very premium. From switching Android to IOS it's bit a different feel can't explain that but yaa it'll take time to adjust.

Best to buy on big billion days to get it for best price we bought 3 colour was good and iphone is all about brand (Apple) and it's camera (cinematic mode) now with improved battery, there is no point for hang in. IOS as they built with bionic chipset smooth and fast performance, go for it if your budget price is within 45-50K
